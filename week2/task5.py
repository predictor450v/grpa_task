Problem Statement

Write a program to calculate the cost of a meal at a restaurant.

The cost of the meal depends on the main dish and the time of the day.
Main dishes available:
"paneer tikka": ₹250
"butter chicken": ₹240
"masala dosa": ₹200
Additional discounts:
15% discount for meals ordered during lunchtime (from 12 PM to 3 PM).
Customers can apply vouchers for an additional 10% discount on the total cost.
The restaurant accepts card payments.
For card payments, there's an additional service charge of 5% on the total cost after applying any discounts.
Take the following inputs:
Main dish : str
Time of the day: int: 24-hour format
Whether the customer has a voucher: bool: True/False
Whether the payment is by card: bool: True/False
Calculate and display the total cost of the meal.'''
