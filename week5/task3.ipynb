    "You are given a matrix of size m x n consisting of ones (1) and zeros (0). There is a single continuous path formed with ones that starts from the rightmost cell in the last row (m-th row) with one and ends at leftmost cell in the first row with one in it. The path does not branch, and there is only one such path. Your task is to traverse along the path and print the coordinates of the path from start to end as tuples over multiple lines. The path can move vertically and horizontally.\n",
